// Since we are running in Node, we need to mock Zustand's create behavior if necessary, 
// but since we are importing source directly, we might need a bundler or ts-node.
// Simpler approach: Copy the relevant store logic into a standalone JS file for testing.

// I will create a standalone JS file that replicates the store logic I am debugging.
// This is safer than trying to import TS files in a raw Node environment without configuration.
